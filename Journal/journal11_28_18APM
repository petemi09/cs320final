Today Mitchell and I talked about how we can enhance our report by adding in another city and looking at the weather there as well as crime in general. St. Paul the other city we chose because they are somewhat similar in size and there is the difference in weather. We anticipate that the weather in St. Paul will affect the crime rates more than in Seattle. With that, today we went to the St. Paul government website and found data sets on the weather and on crime.
