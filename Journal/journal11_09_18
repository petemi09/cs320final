Andrew:

Today I found and looked over a second dataset that will be used in conjunction to the crime dataset. I began to combine the two data sets in on jupyter. I looked over again what we are planning on finding from our dataset. In addition, I also created the index.html and the other couple pages we are going to use for our final project. This part required html. This part is just setting the foundation for putting our final report together.
