I continued looking at the graphs and wrote about two more paragraphs reporting on the graphs. I am connecting the graphs and referring them to one another. I wrote about the year 2014 and the crime count and weather temperature for the each day. I also wrote about crime count for below 30 degrees and what was noticed in the sub categories.
