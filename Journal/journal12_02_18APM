I took some of Mitchell's pie charts and dug deeper into them. For instance, we looked at the crimes for St. Paul and Seattle over the entire data set, I followed up the chart with looking specifically at both the categories that were the largest in each. Theft was the largest one in each city and I was able to break it down further with another pie chart looking at what specific theft it was referencing. This was done for both Seattle and St. Paul.
