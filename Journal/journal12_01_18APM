I continued looking specifically into the St. Paul and looked at the crime counts during the Summer and Winter months for the year 2015. We said that June, July, and August were the months we decided on for the summer. The months we decided for winter were December of 2014 and January and February of 2015. This was also done for the Seattle Data and we used the same months for the respective charts.
