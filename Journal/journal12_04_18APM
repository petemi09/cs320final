Tonight we just went over some final parts and clarifications of our project before the presentation tomorrow morning. We ran through the website a couple times, fixed some of the css and other html items. Some final analysis was done as well as pushing it all to github one last time. The will host the website on github.io

Thanks for reading my journals.
